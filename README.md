# The-Complete-2022-Web-Development-Boot-Camp
A course I took in August 2022 to learn Full-Stack Web Development.

One of the main things I learned from this course if the importance of the documentation. There are so many functionalities that are available in the documentation that I probably don't know. So, whenever I'm stuck or want to do something, the documentation (search "HTML MDN") is very helpful.
