                <h2>Hi There!</h2>
                <p>
                    I am a rising senior currently pursuing my high school diploma from Tesla STEM
                    High School where I am President of Cricket Club, Secretary of Programming 
                    Club, and Treasurer of TSA (Technology Student Association). I am also participating
                    in a Machine Learning Research Project with a former UW Professor.
                    Alongside that, I am the Founder of a non-profit organization (YTDF) with a 
                    demonstrated interest in computer science. I am Skilled in Python, C++, Java, HTML, CSS, 
                    Javascript, and Octave. As one of my external achievementnts, I am a national cricket
                    player (batsman).

                    <h3>Python</h3>
                    <p>
                        One of my best skills is Python as I have completed several Machine Learning projects
                        with it. One with a UW Professor and several by myself on a regular basis. I think Python
                        is going to be the leading languages of the future because of how easy it is to learn 
                        as well as how it can be applied to so many different areas of Computer Science. Recently,
                        I have been using Python for feature engineering, web scraping, etc. in 
                        my Machine Learning projects, and using one language for all of that is very efficient.

                    <h3>Machine Learning</h3>
                    <p>I believe that there is a paramount of potential in the Machine Learning field
                        which is why I was fascinated with it in the first place. The evergrowing field
                        brings out my curiosity which I have demonstrated through the completion of
                        several projects. Be it the Cricket Integration project I completed with my 
                        UW Professor, as a mentor, or be it the Kaggle projects I have completed recently
                        to improve my knowledge of Data Science and Machine Learning. I hope to be a Data
                        Scientist in the future!
